# Manhattan Taxifare

<h3> Using data manipulation, data visualization, trees, and random forest I was able to build a heat map that shows the highest rate of taxi trips and taxi fares.

# <h3> The code begins with visualizing the data on the map of Manhattan by showing us a map using a tidyverse funciton.
<h3> I then went on to build the fitted tree to gain further insight on the data.
  
<h3> After inspecting the tree, I built the random forest.
  
<h3> Lastly, I used the information I gained to deduce that downtown Manhattan spends the most on taxi fare and has the most trips.
